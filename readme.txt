a) Store the Points
    For this step, we store the points in recognizer.py line 10

b) Store some Templates
    For this step, we used another python file called stored_gestures.py dedicated to soley storing the gesture points

c) Implement the $1 Algorithm
    1) Resampling
        Can be found in recognizer.py line 21
    2) Rotation
        Can be found in recognizer.py line 69
 
    3) Scaling + Translation
        Can be found in recognizer.py lines 82 and 99 respectively
    
    4) matching process
        Can be found in recognizer.py lines 111 to 192

d) Output the Result
